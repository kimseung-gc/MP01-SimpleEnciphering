## Description
```
I created a program that can encrypt alphabets into CaesarCipher and VigenèreCipher.
CaesarCipher takes in encoded/decoded message, and decodes/encodes it by trying 26 
combinations of keys that are possible; similar with CaesarCipher, VigenéreCipher
takes in an ecoded/decoded message, and encodes/decodes with the given key to the
message. (e.x. VigenereCipher("hello", "cap") = {'h'+'c', 'e'+'a', 'l'+'p', 
'l'+'c', 'o' + 'a'}.toString() = "jeano").
